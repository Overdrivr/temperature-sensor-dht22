# Temperature sensor
For now a logger for temperature & humidity.
Later, it will move to wifi-connected.
The code runs on any arduino, but ultimately it will move to an ESP8266 for:

* sending telemetry to a local home server
* over-the-air update
* remote control

# Requirements
* https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
* Logger shield (for now)
